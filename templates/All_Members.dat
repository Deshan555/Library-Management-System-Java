        Book Care Rules:

        • Keep books clean; make sure hands are clean before touching.

        • Keep books in a safe place away from babies, pets, food, and liquids.

        • Turn pages carefully from the corner and use a bookmark to mark your place. Never write or draw in a
        book or ear mark pages.

        • When you are not reading your library books, keep them in your backpack or in your Lecture Hall in Campus.
