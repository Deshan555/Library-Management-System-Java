For all Students of Engineering School,

Book Care Rules:

• Keep books clean; make sure hands are clean before touching.
• Keep books in a safe place away from babies, pets, food, and liquids.
• Turn pages carefully from the corner and use a bookmark to mark your place. Never write or draw in a
book or ear mark pages.
• When you are not reading your library books, keep them in your backpack or in your Lecture Hall in Campus.

Library Policies:

1. Borrowing books from the library is free. There is no charge for checking out books unless a title is lost
or damaged.

2. When a student checks out a book, that student should look through the book for any damage or
concerns. If found, they need to notify the teacher immediately.

3. Classrooms will visit the library each week. Students will not be permitted to check out a book unless
they have returned previously checked out books.

4. If a book has not been returned after 4 weeks without notice of renewal, the book will be considered
lost.

5. If a book is lost or damaged, the student must pay to replace it. The majority of our books cost
between $4-10.

6. If a student damages or loses a book, they should bring it to the attention of the Library Staff. Never try
to repair a book, most repairs can be done by the teacher to avoid a fine.
