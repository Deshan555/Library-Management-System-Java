# RFID Based Library System

Libraries are very important aspects for humans. They are essential in acquiring and retaining the knowledge of a person. But the earlier library system has caused many problems. This project helps to identify the large number of tagged books using radio waves. The database shows the availability of the book in the library so that the student can search in the database and if available, they can collect book from the library. It helps to handle the issue, renewal and return process via RFID tags easily. Student will get notified about the due date of book using GSM. If the student failed to return the book after the due date corresponding fine will be generated based on the time period. RFID EAS system is used for theft detection at the library.
