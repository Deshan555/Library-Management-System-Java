Welcome to the RFID Based Library System with Data Visualization Dashboard! 📚🔍 This comprehensive library management system combines RFID technology with powerful data visualization to bring you a cutting-edge solution for managing your library efficiently.

## 📖 Project Background
Libraries are very important for humans. They are essential in acquiring and retaining the knowledge of a person. But the earlier library system has caused many problems. This project aims to revolutionize library management by introducing RFID technology. With RFID tags attached to books, the system can efficiently identify and track a large number of tagged books using radio waves.

The database in the system displays the availability of books in the library, enabling students to easily search for their desired books. Once found available, students can conveniently collect it from the library. The RFID technology streamlines the issue, renewal, and return process, making it faster and more convenient for all library users.

Moreover, students receive timely notifications about the due date of books through GSM communication. This ensures that they are reminded to return books on time. In case of late returns, the system automatically generates corresponding fines based on the time period.

Additionally, the library is equipped with an RFID EAS system for theft detection, enhancing security measures within the library premises.
